This project is designed for the implementation and testing of **Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)** in a network environment. 
The purpose of this project is to create a **reliable and resilient network** using HSRP to enhance **accessibility and flexibility** in organizational networks.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
- Configure **HSRP** between multiple routers to improve **network stability** and **availability**  
- Test **failover** and **recovery** in case of router failure

- ## 🔧 Features
- Topology includes two **switch-core** configured with HSRP  
- Use of **Linux DHCP Server** for IP address allocation    
- Fully tested scenario with attention to potential errors and various tests

- ## 🛠️ تکنولوژی‌ها
- **HSRP**  
- **Linux DHCP Server**  
- **Cisco Switches**
