Linux DHCP Server Description
The Linux DHCP Server provides automated assignment and management of IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and DNS information to client devices in a network. Using ISC DHCP (one of the most popular implementations), it ensures efficient network configuration, minimizing manual IP management.

Key Features:
Dynamic IP Allocation: Automatically assigns IP addresses to client devices from a predefined pool.
Static IP Reservations: Allows binding specific IPs to MAC addresses for important devices.
Support for Subnetting: Manages multiple networks with granular configuration.
Security Options: Works seamlessly with security configurations such as DHCP Snooping.
Why Use a Linux DHCP Server?
Flexibility: Easily configurable for small to enterprise environments.
Stability: Reliable under high loads and complex networks.
Integration: Compatible with various monitoring and logging tools for better network management.
This setup is ideal for scalable, secure, and automated IP management in dynamic environments.
